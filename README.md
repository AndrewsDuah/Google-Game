# Google-Game
Automated Player for the Google Dinosaur Game ðŸ¦–ðŸŽ®
This project showcases an Arduino-based automated player for the Google Dinosaur game, demonstrating the integration of basic electronics and programming for interactive automation. The setup includes:

Arduino Uno: The central controller for the automation system.
Servo Motor: Used to simulate pressing the spacebar to make the dinosaur jump.
Photodetector: Monitors the game screen to detect obstacles.
Breadboard & Jumper Cables: For building and connecting the circuit.
How It Works
Obstacle Detection: The photodetector scans the game screen, distinguishing between the white background and black obstacles.
Action Triggering: Upon detecting an obstacle, the Arduino processes the color change and activates the servo motor.
Automated Response: The servo motor rotates to press the spacebar, allowing the dinosaur to jump and clear the obstacle.
This project illustrates how basic electronic components and programming can be combined to create an automated system that interacts with a digital environment. Itâ€™s a fun and practical way to explore sensor-based decision-making and automation!

Feel free to explore and contribute to the code and hardware setup!
